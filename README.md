As I said in the Issues folder, the russet didn't work for my because the libraries couldn't be loaded so when I tried to run the commands, it only gave errors. The thematicmaps package didn't load either even though I did download the following file: thematicmaps_2.1.tar.gz but when I read it in R-studio it gave errors, saying it could not read the file.
